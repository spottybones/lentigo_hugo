title: Upgraded to Drupal 5.1
url: /node/15
---

As part one of attempting to get back to blogging at this site I've upgraded it from Drupal 4.7 to Drupal 5.

The old theme was quite ugly so I switched the system default to Drupal's Garland theme and changed the colors to that sort of mix of sunburn and suntan than **Lentigo** suggests!  This looks better than the themes I've come up with in the past so I think I'll stick with it.

This will have to be it for my first update in almost a year as my battery -- both computer and body -- are about to run out.

I&rsquo;ve been taking their SANS+S course for preparation to take the CISSP exam.
This particular class is taught on-line using a Java-based classroom product
called Elluminate.  It&rsquo;s always taken a bit of work to start it up on my
PowerBook and I generally expect to have to kill and restart it a few times
before it gets a good connection back to the mothership.  Tonight was worse
than usual, requiring a reboot &ndash; thankfully fast on a Mac &ndash; and hunting down
and deleting old Java Webstart cache files.   By the time I got it sorted and
got into my class it was already 30 minutes in and too late to get into the
flow.  I had a lot I wanted to get done this evening anyway so I bagged the
class; I can listen to a recording later and get caught up.   I&rsquo;m in no wild
hurry to get my CISSP so will be spending a couple months studying up and take
the test this summer.  I already hold a current SANS GSEC cert and the subject
matter isn&rsquo;t wildly different.</p>

<p>On the win side I think we&rsquo;ve finally gotten Chris&rsquo;
<a href="http://www.chrisabraham.com">blog</a> moved from MediaTemple to a dedicated
server.  It&rsquo;s a largish site that, was getting killed by performance problems
with the (mt) GridServer system.   I think the full site &ldquo;rebuild&rdquo; is just
about done so he should be back in business in no time.  I hope it finishes
soon, I&rsquo;m tired and want to sleep.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/webhosting/gs/">gs</a> sounds good in theory, but
in practice it&rsquo;s been a disappointment and I think needs another six months of
testing and tweaks before it&rsquo;ll be ready for prime time.  I won&rsquo;t be around
then, I&rsquo;m going to be moving this site back to my trusty
<a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a> as soon as I get the time.</p>
